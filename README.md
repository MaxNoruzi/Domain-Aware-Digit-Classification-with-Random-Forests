# 🔢 Domain-Aware Digit Classification with Random Forests

This project focuses on classifying digit images from multiple **domains** using **Random Forest classifiers**. It includes training and evaluation strategies that account for domain labels, adaptive training sets, confusion matrix analysis, and performance visualization across domain and digit tasks.
